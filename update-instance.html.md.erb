This topic describes how to scale, or change configurations on a
<%= vars.product_full %> instance. It also covers how to update a Tanzu MySQL instance after an Operator upgrade. 

## <a id='prereq'></a> Prerequisites

Before you update the MySQL instance, you must have:

* **Access and permissions to the MySQL instance.**

* **The Kubernetes Command Line Interface (kubectl) installed:**
For more information, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/).
* **An upgraded Operator**: This prerequisite is not applicable to users that are only updating instance configuration details. 

## <a id='update-instance'></a> Updating an Instance 

1. After an Operator upgrade, review the Operator's supported MySQL versions by running:

    ```
    kubectl get mysqlversions
    ```
    
    The command displays an ouput similar to:
    
    ```
    NAME           DB VERSION
    mysql-8.0.25   8.0.25
    mysql-8.0.26   8.0.26
    mysql-8.0.27   8.0.27
    mysql-latest   8.0.27     
    ```
    
    The list indicates the three versions that are supported by this specific Operator you upgraded to. 

1. List the of your existing instances, to verify any expected user actions. The user actions are estimated based on the Operator supported MySQL versions. From Tanzu Operator 1.4.0 the output of the `kubectl get mysql` command has been enhanced to include `UPDATE STATUS` and `USER ACTION` column. 

    ```
    $ kubectl get mysql
    ```
    The output is similar to:
    
    ```
    NAME          READY   STATUS    AGE    TANZU VERSION   DB VERSION   UPDATE STATUS       USER ACTION
         
    instance-10   true    Running   41m    1.4.0           8.0.25
    DBUPDONC-9    true    Running   20d    1.3.0           8.0.26       UpdateRequired      Annotate “mysql.with.sql.tanzu.vmware.com/update=once” 
    instance-8    true    Running   21d    1.3.0           8.0.25       UpdateRequired      Annotate “mysql.with.sql.tanzu.vmware.com/update=once” 
    instance-7    true    Running   22d    1.3.0           8.0.23       DBUpgradeRequired   Set spec.mysqlVersion.name to a supported DB version
    DBAUTOUPG-6   true    Running   120d   1.2.0           8.0.26       UpdateRequired      Annotate “mysql.with.sql.tanzu.vmware.com/update=once” 
    instance-5    true    Running   121d   1.2.0           8.0.25       UpdateRequired      Annotate “mysql.with.sql.tanzu.vmware.com/update=once”         
    instance-4    true    Running   122d   1.2.0           8.0.23       DBUpgradeRequired   Set spec.mysqlVersion.name to a supported DB version
    DBAUTOUPG-3   true    Running   150d   1.1.0           8.0.25       UpdateRequired      Annotate “mysql.with.sql.tanzu.vmware.com/update=once”           
    instance-2    true    Running   151d   1.1.0           8.0.23       DBUpgradeRequired   Set spec.mysqlVersion.name to a supported DB version
    instance-1    true    Running   202d   1.0.0           8.0.23       DBUpgradeRequired   Set spec.mysqlVersion.name to a supported DB version                              
    ```

1. Check the `UPDATE STATUS` column. Note the instances with an update value = "UpdateRequired". These instances have a supported MySQL version under the upgraded Operator, but need to be brought up-to-date or reconciled, to maintain a self healing Kubernetes profile. 

1. As per the `USER ACTION` column, use the Kubernetes method of Annotations to push a one time action. After the annotate action, these instances can use all the new features of the upgraded Operator.

    **WARNING**: Annotating an instance will cause instance reboot. Plan your instance annotations according to your applications maintenance windows. 
    
    The `USER ACTION` text `Annotate "mysql.with.sql.tanzu.vmware.com/update=once"` requires the user to run a command similar to:

    ```
    kubectl annotate mysql instance-8 mysql.with.sql.tanzu.vmware.com/update=once
    ```

    The annotation is removed the moment the instance update is complete. You may rerun the command `kubectl get mysql` to verify that the reconciliation is complete.

## <a id='scale-storage'></a> Scale storageSize

For storage classes that support `storageSize`, you can expand the `storageSize`
but not reduce it.

To scale `storageSize`:

1. Target the namespace where you want to scale `storageSize`:

    ```
    kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=DEVELOPMENT-NAMESPACE
    ```
    Where `DEVELOPMENT-NAMESPACE` is the namespace in which you want to scale `storageSize`.

    For example:

    ``` 
    kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=my-namespace
    ``` 

1. Look up the storage class associated with the MySQL Pod’s Persistent Volume Claim (PVC):

    ```
    kubectl get pvc mysql-data-INSTANCE-NAME-N -o jsonpath={.spec.storageClassName}
    ```
    Where:
    + `INSTANCE-NAME` is the value that you configured for metadata.name for your MySQL resource.
    + `N` is the index of the Pod in the MySQL instance.

    For example:

    ``` 
    kubectl get pvc mysql-data-mysql-sample-0 -o jsonpath={.spec.storageClassName}
      standard
    ``` 

1. Check if the storage class allows volume expansion. Look for the `ALLOWVOLUMEEXPANSION` column by running:

    ```
    kubectl get storageclass CLASS-RETURNED
    ```
    Where `CLASS-RETURNED` is the `storageclass` associated with the MySQL Pod's PVC from the previous step.

    For example:

    ``` 
    kubectl get storageclass standard
    ```
    ```
    NAME                 PROVISIONER            RECLAIMPOLICY   VOLUMEBINDINGMODE    ALLOWVOLUMEEXPANSION   AGE
    standard (default)   kubernetes.io/gce-pd   Delete          Immediate            true                   91s
    ``` 

1. If the output does not show the `ALLOWVOLUMEEXPANSION` column, run:
    ```
    kubectl get storageclasses.storage.k8s.io standard \
    -o custom-columns='NAME:.metadata.name,ALLOWVOLUMEEXPANSION:.allowVolumeExpansion'
    ``` 

1. If you are using Kubernetes v1.11 and volume expansion is supported, change the `allowVolumeExpansion` field to `true`
      in StorageClass objects. Only PVCs created from a StorageClass with `allowVolumeExpansion`
      set to `true` are allowed to perform volume expansion.
      For more information, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#expanding-persistent-volumes-claims).

1. Edit the PVC `spec.resources.requests.storage` field to increase the volume size by running:

    ```
    kubectl patch pvc mysql-data-INSTANCE-NAME-N -p \
    '{"spec": {"resources": {"requests": {"storage": "NEW-REQUESTED-SIZE"}}}}'
    ```
    Where:
    + `INSTANCE-NAME` is the value that you configured for metadata.name for your MySQL resource.
    + `N` is the index of the Pod in the MySQL instance.
    + `NEW-REQUESTED-SIZE` is the increased volume size.

    For example:
    ``` 
    kubectl patch pvc mysql-data-mysql-sample-0 -p '{"spec": {"resources": {"requests": {"storage": "50Gi"}}}}'
    ``` 

1. Do one of the following:
    * **If the storageClass supports online expansion:**
      Wait for the PVC to automatically resize. For more information, see the
      [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#resizing-an-in-use-persistentvolumeclaim).<br><br>
    * **Otherwise:** Wait for the PVC to have the `FileSystemResizePending` condition.
    Delete the MySQL Pod to unmount the PVC and allow it to resize.
    ```
    kubectl wait --for=condition=FileSystemResizePending pvc/mysql-data-INSTANCE-NAME-N
    ``` 
    ``` 
    kubectl rollout restart statefulset INSTANCE-NAME
    ``` 
    
    For example:
    ``` 
    kubectl wait --for=condition=FileSystemResizePending pvc/mysql-data-mysql-sample-0
    ```
    ```
    persistentvolumeclaim/mysql-data-mysql-sample-0 condition met 
    ```
    ```
    kubectl rollout restart statefulset mysql-sample
    ```
    ```
    statefulset.apps/mysql-sample restarted
    ``` 

1. After the StatefulSet controller has automatically re-created the MySQL Pod, and the MySQL Pod
has successfully restarted, verify that the storage has been resized.

    ```
    kubectl exec INSTANCE-NAME-N -c mysql -- df -h /var/lib/mysql
    ```
    Where:
    + `INSTANCE-NAME` is the value that you configured for metadata.name for your MySQL resource.
    + `N` is the index of the Pod in the MySQL instance.

    For example:
    ``` 
    kubectl exec mysql-sample-0 -c mysql -- df -h /var/lib/mysql
    ```
    ```
    Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
    /dev/sdb        3.0G  346M  2.6G  12% /var/lib/mysql
    ``` 

### <a id='scale-storage-downtime'></a> Expected Downtime When Scaling storageSize

For HA instances, no downtime is expected.

For single-node instances, the expected downtime when expanding storage is as follows:

- With online expansion: There is no downtime expected in most cases.
- With offline expansion: There is downtime while the MySQL Pod is re-created and the
PVC is being resized.

## <a id='scale-resources'></a> Scale CPU and Memory Resources

To scale CPU or memory resources, update the MySQL configuration `spec.resources` field to change the CPU
or memory requirements for the mysql or sidecar containers.

You can use one of these methods to update the configuration:

* Patch the existing API object in place by running:

    ```
    kubectl patch mysql INSTANCE-NAME --type merge -p \
    '{"spec": {"resources": {"mysql": MYSQL-RESOURCES, " mysqlSidecar": SIDECAR-RESOURCES}}}'
    ```

    Where:
    + `INSTANCE-NAME` is the value that you configured for metadata.name for your MySQL resource.
    + `MYSQL-RESOURCES` is a collection of `cpu` and `memory` limits and requests for the `mysql` container.
    + `SIDECAR-RESOURCES` is a collection of `cpu` and `memory` limits and requests for the `mysql-sidecar` container.

    For example:
    ``` 
    kubectl patch mysql mysql-sample --type merge -p '{"spec": {"resources": {"mysql": {"requests": {"cpu": "500m"}}, "mysqlSidecar": {"limits": {"memory": "64Mi"}}}}}'
    ``` 

* If you manage MySQL resources with a set of configuration files in source control, you can also
    change the fields in the file and apply the changes.

    For example:
    ``` 
    kubectl apply -f mysql.yaml
    ``` 

For more information on managing CPU and Memory resources, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/).

### <a id='scale-resources-downtime'></a> Expected Downtime When Scaling CPU and Memory Resources

For HA instances, no downtime is expected.

For single-node instances, the expected downtime when changing resource reservations is as follows:

- Brief downtime while Kubernetes re-creates the MySQL Pods.
- Risk of longer downtime if the new requested values exceed the available capacity
of the Kubernetes cluster.

## <a id='other-config'></a> Change Other Configurations

Changing `storageClassName` or `imagePullSecretName` on a running MySQL instance is not supported and it returns an error. 
If a MySQL instance is not running due to errors in these fields, you can change them.
The changes are propagated into the StatefulSet to correct the error.

<p class="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> You cannot modify <code>storageClassName</code> for a successfully created MySQL instance.
</p>

To change `storageClassName` or `imagePullSecretName`,
update the MySQL configuration by one of the methods below:

* Patch the existing API object in place:

    ```
    kubectl patch mysql INSTANCE-NAME -p '{"spec": {"PROPERTY": "VALUE"}}'
    ```
    Where:
    + `INSTANCE-NAME` is the value that you configured for metadata.name for your MySQL resource.
    + `PROPERTY` is the property name.
    + `VALUE` is the new property value.

    For example:
    ``` 
    kubectl patch mysql mysql-sample -p '{"spec": {"imagePullSecretName": "new-secret-name"}}'
    ``` 

* If you manage MySQL resources with a set of configuration files in source control, you can
    change the fields in the file and apply the changes.

    For example:
    ``` 
    kubectl apply -f mysql.yaml
    ``` 

For information about the properties,
see [Property Reference for the MySQL Resource](property-reference-mysql.html).
