## Style Guide

This is a word list for terminology and word usage specific to the VMware Tanzu SQL with MySQL for VMs docs.

| Word | Explanation |
|------|-------------|
| administrator | Use as a person's job description instead of operator. Decided: JD, Kim Bassett, and David Sharp 2020.12.09. If this specifically refers to the Kubernetes administrator, use "Kubernetes administrator" in first use on the page. |
| Kubernetes administrator | See "administrator" above. |
| operator | Don't use as a job description for a person. Use as the "Kuberenetes operator". |
| Pod  | From the [word list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hkadtxR1hY57kK7h5HN4ITHLJleZixCDH_RJPUpNq_A/edit?usp=sharing) |
| TanzuMySQL instance  | Use this phrase consistently. Okay to shorten it to "instance". Not okay to use "MySQL instance" or "Tanzu instance" or "database instance". "TanzuMySQL" is a _kind_ in Kubernetes so that it the precise term. Decided: JD, Kim Bassett, and David Sharp 2020.12.09.|
