title: Backup and Restore in Tanzu MySQL for Kubernetes
owner: MySQL
---

Overview of Backup and Restore
* Backup and restore consists of the following CRDs:
  * TanzuMysqlBackup - References a TanzuMysql backup artifact that exists in an
    external blobstore (S3, Minio, ...)
  * TanzuMysqlBackupLocation - References an external blobstore and credentials
    necessary to access the blobstore.
  * TanzuMysqlBackupSchedule - Represents a CronJob schedule on which to perform
    backups.
  * TanzuMysqlRestore - References an instance of a restore that was performed.
...

Creating a BackupLocation
* Example YAML file:
```

DEVELOPER-FACING DOCSET

<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to deploy and delete <%= vars.product_full %> instances.

## <a id='prereq'></a>Prerequisites
Prerequisites

* Kubectl CLI
* Developers must have permissions in order to perform the following actions to all custom resources under the mysql.tanzu.vmware.com Kubernetes API group:
  * create
  * delete
  * deletecollection
  * get
  * list
  * patch
  * update
  * watch

## <a id='create-instance'></a>Create a <%= vars.product_short %> instance
Create a <%= vars.product_short %> instance

1. Target development NAMESPACE where they want to create the <%= vars.product_short %> instances
1. Create the secret:

kubectl --namespace=[TANZU-MYSQL-OPERATOR-NAMESPACE] create secret docker-registry tanzu-mysql-image-registry --docker-server=[REGISTRY-SERVER-URL] --docker-username=[DOCKER-USERNAME] --docker-password=[DOCKER-PASSWORD]

This Kubernetes secret can point to the TanzuNet registry, or a private registry that you have configured for your Kubernetes environment. If you do not have access to the registry credentials, you must contact your kubernetes administrator to have these set up for you in your NAMESPACE.

### <a id='create-yaml'></a>Create a `tanzumysql.yaml` file.
* Create a `tanzumysql.yaml` file. This is the configuration file for the <%= vars.product_short %> instance.

    ```
    apiVersion: mysql.tanzu.vmware.com/v1alpha1
    kind: TanzuMySQL
    metadata:
      name: tanzumysql-sample
    spec:
      storageSize: 1Gi
      imagePullSecret: tanzu-mysql-image-registry

    #### Set the storage class name to change storage class of the PVC associated with this resource
    #  storageClassName: standard

    #### Examples to set resource limit/request for mysql/backup pods.

    #  resources:

    #### This is the container running the mysql server.
    #    mysql:
    #      limits:
    #        cpu: 3
    #        memory: 800Mi
    #      requests:
    #        cpu: 2
    #        memory: 500Mi
    #### This is the sidecar container that takes a backup and streams to the storage backend.
    #    backups:
    #      limits:
    #        cpu: 2
    #        memory: 500Mi
    #      requests:
    #        cpu: 1
    #        memory: 200Mi
    ```

* Talk about the values you can set in `tanzumysql.yaml`

## <a id='deploy-instance'></a>Deploy Instance to Kubernetes
* kubectl -n YOUR_NAMESPACE apply -f tanzumysql.yaml
* Verify that is was successfully created:
kubectl get tanzumysql INSTANCE_NAME



## <a id='delete-instance'></a>Delete a <%= vars.product_short %> instance
Delete a <%= vars.product_short %> instance

    kubectl -n YOUR_NAMESPACE delete tanzumysql INSTANCE_NAME

* If you want, also delete the Persistent Volume Claim (PVC).
1. Review your PVCs

    `kubectl get pvc`

1. `kubectl delete pvc POD_NAME` for each pod in the <%= vars.product_short %> instance.

WARNING: This is a destructive action. If you destroy your PVC, you are deleting all associated data with your <%= vars.product_short %> database.


NOTE: If you delete the Pod or Statefulset associated with the <%= vars.product_short %> resource, a <%= vars.product_short %> controller will recreate it for you. If you want to permanently delete the instance, you need to delete the `tanzumysql` resource.
