This topic explains how you, as a developer, connect an app to your Tanzu MySQL instance.

## <a id='AboutTile'></a>About Binding Apps to a Tanzu MySQL Instance

After you have created a Tanzu MySQL instance,
the next task is to bind it to your app so that your app can access the database.

You do this by obtaining the password for the root database user and the IP address for the
Tanzu MySQL instance and then adding these connection parameters to the app environment variables.


## <a id='prereq'></a>Prerequisites

Before you bind an app to a Tanzu MySQL instance, you must have:

<%# is there a reason why we use a the TKGI docs installation here and not the k8s docs installation? %>
* **The Kubernetes Command Line Interface (kubectl):**
  See [Installing the Kubernetes CLI](https://docs.pivotal.io/tkgi/installing-kubectl-cli.html).

* **Permission to read Kubernetes secrets in your target namespace:**
  For information about Roles and RoleBindings that your Kubernetes cluster admin needs to create
  to grant permissions,
  see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/).

    <p class="note">
        <strong>Note:</strong> To avoid Kubernetes permissions issues,
       VMware recommends that developers have admin access to their target namespace.
    </p>

* **A Tanzu MySQL instance running in the same Kubernetes cluster as the app:**
  This is required. The ServiceType is ClusterIP.
  However, instances can be in a different namespace from the app.<br>
  For how to create an instance, see [Creating and Deleting a Tanzu MySQL Instance](create-delete-mysql.html).<br>
  For information about the ClusterIP ServiceType, see the
  [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types).

## <a id='retrieve-creds'></a>Retrieve Connection Parameters for the Tanzu MySQL Instance

To connect the app to the database, you provide the app with:

*  The root username and password for the database
*  The IP address for the Tanzu MySQL instance

This procedure describes how to find these connection parameters.

To retrieve connection parameters:

1. Obtain the password for the root user of the database by running:

    ```
    kubectl get secret INSTANCE-NAME-credentials -o jsonpath='{.data.rootPassword}' | base64 -D
    ```

    Where `INSTANCE-NAME` is the name of the Tanzu MySQL instance.

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ kubectl get secret tanzumysql-sample-credentials \
      -o jsonpath='{.data.rootPassword}' | base64 -D
    examplepassword
    </pre>

2. Record the password string, for example, `examplepassword`.
   You need it to complete the [Connect your App to the MySQL Database](#connect-app) below.

3. Obtain the IP address of the Tanzu MySQL instance by running:

    ```
    kubectl get service INSTANCE-NAME
    ```

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">$ kubectl get service tanzumysql-sample

    â†’ kubectl get service tanzumysql-sample
NAME                TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)              AGE
tanzumysql-sample   ClusterIP   10.110.144.49   <none>        3306/TCP,33060/TCP   5d22h
    </pre>

2. Record the value of the `CLUSTER-IP`, for example, `10.110.144.49`.
   You need it to complete the [Connect your App to the MySQL Database](#connect-app) below.

## <a id='connect-app'></a>Connect your App to the MySQL Database

To connect your app to the MySQL database on the Tanzu MySQL instance:

1. Manually configure the app environment variables with the connection parameters
   that you recorded above.

2. Apply these changes to establish a connection to the database.
