This topic describes how operators upgrade the <%= vars.product_full %> Operator.

## <a id="upgrade-operator"></a>  Use the Helm CLI to Upgrade the Operator

To upgrade <%= vars.product_short %>, you must download resources and upgrade
the <%= vars.product_short %> Operator using Helm.

To upgrade the Operator using the Helm CLI:


1. Set the environment variable to enable OCI support in the Helm v3 client by running:

    ```
    export HELM_EXPERIMENTAL_OCI=1
    ```

    If you skip this step, the following error message might appear:
    ``` Error: this feature has been marked as experimental and is not enabled by default.``` 

1. Use Helm to log in to the Tanzu Network Registry by running:

    ```
    helm registry login registry.tanzu.vmware.com
    ```

    Follow the prompts to enter the email address and password for your <%= vars.product_network %> account.

1. Verify that you have a running <%= vars.product_short %> Operator by running:

    ```
    helm -n tanzu-mysql-for-kubernetes-system ls
    ```
    For example:

    ``` 
    helm -n tanzu-mysql-for-kubernetes-system ls
    NAME                    NAMESPACE                               REVISION        UPDATED                                 STATUS          CHART                                   APP VERSION
    tanzu-mysql-operator    tanzu-mysql-for-kubernetes-system       1               2021-04-01 12:15:07.16966 -0500 CDT     deployed        tanzu-sql-with-mysql-operator-1.0.0     1.0.0
    ```

1.  Create a temporary directory to export the chart by running:

	```
	CHART_DIR=$(mktemp -d /tmp/tanzu-mysql-operator-chart:${VERSION-NUMBER-TAG}.XXXXX)
	```

1. Download the Helm chart to your current working directory on your local machine by running these commands:

    ```
    helm chart pull ${REGISTRY-URL}
    ```
    ```
    helm chart export ${REGISTRY-URL} -d ${CHART_DIR}
    ```
    Where `REGISTRY-URL` is the reference to the <%= vars.product_short %> Helm chart. The value of `REGISTRY-URL` has the following pattern:

    ```
    registry.tanzu.vmware.com/tanzu-mysql-for-kubernetes/tanzu-mysql-operator-chart:VERSION-NUMBER-TAG
    ```
    Where `VERSION-NUMBER-TAG` is the version of the Helm chart. This downloads a directory named `tanzu-sql-with-mysql-operator/` into your current working directory.

1. In the location where the new release has been downloaded, apply the new CRDs by running:

    ```
    kubectl apply -f ./tanzu-sql-with-mysql-operator/crds/
    ```

    <p class="note">
      <strong>Note:</strong> You can ignore the warnings in the output.
    </p>

1. Upgrade the Operator by running:

    ```
    helm upgrade tanzu-sql-with-mysql-operator ./tanzu-sql-with-mysql-operator
    ```

    When you see `deployed` in the `STATUS` column, the <%= vars.product_short %>
    Helm chart has upgraded:

    ``` 
    helm -n tanzu-mysql-for-kubernetes-system history tanzu-sql-with-mysql-operator
    ```
    ```
    REVISION    UPDATED                     STATUS        CHART                                  APP VERSION    DESCRIPTION
    1           Thu Jan 14 17:47:53 2021    superseded    tanzu-sql-with-mysql-operator-1.0.0     1.0.0          Install complete
    2           Thu Jan 14 18:09:05 2021    deployed      tanzu-sql-with-mysql-operator-1.0.1     1.0.1          Upgrade complete
    ``` 

1. Clean up the temporary directory if it is no longer needed with the exported chart by running:
	```
	rm ${CHART_DIR}
	```

1. Check the status of your existing instances, and plan for an upgrade or an update. 

    Use the command `kubectl get mysqls` and review [List Instance Versions](upgrade-instance.html#upgrade-steps), [Upgrade an Instance](upgrade-instance.html#upgrade-steps) and [Updating an Instance](update-instance.html#update-instance).
