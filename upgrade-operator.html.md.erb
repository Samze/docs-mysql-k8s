title: Upgrading the Tanzu SQL for Kubernetes Operator
owner: MySQL
---


This topic describes how to upgrade the <%= vars.product_full %> Operator.

## <a id="upgrade-operator"></a>  Upgrade the Operator using Helm CLI

To upgrade <%= vars.product_short %>, you must download the resources, and upgrade
the <%= vars.product_short %> Operator using Helm.

These instructions assume your Operator is installed in the Operator namespace `tanzu-mysql-for-kubernetes-system`
as described in Operator Installation documentation. If your Operator is installed in a different  namespace,
replace `tanzu-mysql-for-kubernetes-system` with that namespace in the below commands.

<p class="note"><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> From version 1.4.0, upgrading the Operator does not disrupt or upgrade the existing instances. Be advised that the owners of the instances might be encouraged to upgrade or update their instances. </p>

1. Set the environment variable to enable OCI support in the Helm v3 client by running:

    ```
    export HELM_EXPERIMENTAL_OCI=1
    ```

    If you skip this step, the following error message might appear:
    ``` Error: this feature has been marked as experimental and is not enabled by default.``` 

1. Use Helm to log in to the Tanzu Network Registry by running:

    ```
    helm registry login registry.tanzu.vmware.com
    ```

    Follow the prompts to enter the email address and password for your <%= vars.product_network %> account.

1. Verify that you have a running <%= vars.product_short %> Operator by running:

    ```
    helm ls -n tanzu-mysql-for-kubernetes-system
    ```
    For example:

    ``` 
    helm ls -n tanzu-mysql-for-kubernetes-system
    NAME                    NAMESPACE                               REVISION        UPDATED                                 STATUS          CHART                                   APP VERSION
    tanzu-mysql-operator    tanzu-mysql-for-kubernetes-system       1               2022-03-11 12:15:07.16966 -0500 CDT     deployed        tanzu-sql-with-mysql-operator-1.3.0     1.3.0
    ```

1.  Create a temporary working directory to export the chart into by running:

	```
	CHART_DIR=$(mktemp -d /tmp/tanzu-mysql-operator-chart:1.5.0.XXXXX)
	```

1. Download the Helm chart to your temporary working directory on your local machine by running these commands:

	If you're using Helm CLI 3.6 and earlier:

    ```
    helm chart pull registry.tanzu.vmware.com/tanzu-mysql-for-kubernetes/tanzu-mysql-operator-chart:1.5.0
    ```
    ```
    helm chart export registry.tanzu.vmware.com/tanzu-mysql-for-kubernetes/tanzu-mysql-operator-chart:1.5.0 -d ${CHART_DIR}
    ```


	If you're using Helm CLI 3.7.1 and later:
	```
	helm pull oci://registry.tanzu.vmware.com/tanzu-mysql-for-kubernetes/tanzu-mysql-operator-chart \
	  --version 1.5.0 --untar --untardir ${CHART_DIR}
	```


1. In the location where the new release has been downloaded, apply the new CRDs by running:

    ```
    kubectl apply -f ${CHART_DIR}/tanzu-sql-with-mysql-operator/crds/
    ```

    <p class="note">
      <strong>Note:</strong> You can ignore the warnings in the output.
    </p>

1. Upgrade the Operator by running:

    ```
    helm upgrade tanzu-sql-with-mysql-operator ${CHART_DIR}/tanzu-sql-with-mysql-operator \
      -n tanzu-mysql-for-kubernetes-system
    ```

    When you see `deployed` in the `STATUS` column, the <%= vars.product_short %>
    Helm chart has upgraded:

    ``` 
    helm history tanzu-sql-with-mysql-operator -n tanzu-mysql-for-kubernetes-system
		```
    ```
    REVISION    UPDATED                     STATUS        CHART                                  APP VERSION    DESCRIPTION
    1           Thu Jan 14 17:47:53 2021    superseded    tanzu-sql-with-mysql-operator-1.0.0     1.0.0          Install complete
    2           Thu Jan 14 18:09:05 2021    deployed      tanzu-sql-with-mysql-operator-1.0.1     1.0.1          Upgrade complete
    ```

  If your Operator was previously installed using an Operator Values Override file (or other command-line values overrides, then Helm will re-apply those override values to this upgrade, unless you perform the upgrade with other overrides or with the `--reset-values` flag. See <A HREF="https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_upgrade/">Helm Upgrade documentation</A> for details.

1. Clean up the temporary directory if it is no longer needed with the exported chart by running:
	```
	rm ${CHART_DIR}
	```

## <a id="next-steps"></a>Next Steps

Check the status of your existing instances, and plan for an upgrade or an update. 

Use the command `kubectl get mysqls` and review [List Instance Versions](upgrade-instance.html#upgrade-steps), [Upgrade an Instance](upgrade-instance.html#upgrade-steps) and [Updating an Instance](update-instance.html#update-instance).
